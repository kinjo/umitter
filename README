Umitter is a Twitter bot posts information of the sea-diving condition in
OKINAWA, Japan.

Umitter gets weather information at the time from
http://nihongo.wunderground.com/global/stations/47930.html, then
constructs a pretty message and post to Twitter.

Simple usage is here. At first, you have to edit `umit' file and set 4
variables. For example,

CONSUMER_KEY    = 'CT8CZfNpXQR70f1lIhulAA'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'kXChNfSqY8MN8ZbuuXpKay3Kb2BNGlayZTDkCdRTtJk'
TOKEN           = '78012048-oLP1t0pEnic7oAh4w33KgKOSBkxvw1dfrxEP6ktLQ'
TOKEN_SECRET    = 'ejvQLx0VILHq3kVX15kY0GXwNFHv6hulojCwjn23A4'

So, type as following to run,

ruby ./umit ./sergeant.umit

or

./umit ./sergeant.umit

sergeant.umit is a SDL file to define Umitter's behavior.

To post a message to Twitter, rb-simple-oauth is bundled. it is available
at following Github page.

http://github.com/shibason/rb-simple-oauth
(The simple OAuth sample code for Ruby)

So, if you want scheduling to run periodically, you can use CRON.
