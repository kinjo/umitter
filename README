Umitter is a Twitter bot posts information of the sea diving condition

Umitter gets weather information at the time from
http://nihongo.wunderground.com/global/stations/47930.html, then
constructs a pretty message and post it to Twitter.

rb-simple-oauth is bundled to post to Twitter.
It is available at the following.

So, if you want scheduling to run periodically, you can use CRON.
